Your hour tracking web app is a great project idea, and you're on the right track considering the integration with Google Sheets for data storage and visualization. Here's a step-by-step approach you can take:

1. **Frontend Development (HTML & CSS):**
   - Design your web page with HTML, creating forms for users to input their first and last names, and buttons for clocking in and out.
   - Use CSS for styling the page to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.

2. **JavaScript for Frontend Logic:**
   - Use JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as clicking the clock in/out buttons.
   - Implement the logic to round the time to the nearest 5 minutes in JavaScript.

3. **Backend Integration with Google Sheets (Sheets API):**
   - Use the Google Sheets API to create a new Google Sheet and set up the columns for storing user data.
   - Use the API to add new rows to the Google Sheet whenever a user clocks in or out.

5. **Connecting Frontend with Sheets:**
   - Use JavaScript to send user input data to the Google Sheet.
   - Use JavaScript to retrieve data from the Google Sheet and display it on the frontend.

6. **Displaying Recent Actions Log:**
   - Use Shets API to retrieve recent log entries from your Google Sheet.
   - Send this data back to the frontend and display it dynamically using JavaScript.
