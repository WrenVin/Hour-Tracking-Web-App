Current state of program: 
The frontend UI is complete for now
We are successfully able to pull names and data from google sheets and create cards for each person
Tracking time is complete and interaction with Google Sheet is complete

To do:
Create restrictions for edge cases, such as trying to clock in while already clocked in
Have the cards refresh the time when the button is pressed
